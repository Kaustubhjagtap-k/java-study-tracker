Â Study Tracker App
Overview
The  Study Tracker is a simple yet effective desktop application built with Java Swing, designed to help students and learners manage and track their study sessions. It provides a user-friendly interface to log study activities, including the subject, duration, and a brief description, enabling users to monitor their academic progress efficiently.

This application demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Swing GUI development, and basic data handling.

Features
Intuitive User Interface: A clean and easy-to-navigate graphical interface built with Java Swing.

Study Log Entry: Users can input details for each study session:

Subject: The topic or course studied (e.g., "Java", "C++", "Python").

Duration: The time spent studying in hours (e.g., "3.5", "2.0").

Subtle Animations: Features a smooth fade-in animation for the main window on startup.

Interactive Buttons: Buttons provide visual feedback on hover.

Error Handling: Basic validation for input fields (e.g., ensuring duration is a valid number, and fields are not empty).

Technologies Used
Java (JDK 8 or higher recommended): The core programming language.

Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): For layout managers (BorderLayout, GridLayout).
